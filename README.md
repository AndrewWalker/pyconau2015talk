# PyConAU 2015 Talk

## Not Invented Here: Porting Scientific Software to Python

These are the slides and tools for building slides for my PyConAU talk.

## Usage

These slides can be built using:
- pandoc
- reveal.js 

Final styling will be done by hand or with some css / js tweaks, or, if styling
ends up being to difficult, I can change to use LaTeX and beamer slides.
